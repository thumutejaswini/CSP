<h2>AYUSH Courses</h2>
<p>AYUSH stands for Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. Both Homeopathy and Ayurveda are alternative medicine systems under AYUSH that are being practised all over the world. While Ayurvedic medicine equips students with the knowledge of curing doshas i.e. dysfunctions of the body, the homoeopathy courses train students in curing diseases by improving their inner strength. Due to its widespread use, the Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery(BHMS) and the Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) have garnered popularity. Both of these courses last for 5.5 years. If not BHMS or BAMS, you can pursue the following diploma courses in Ayurveda and homoeopathy with the medical stream:</p>
