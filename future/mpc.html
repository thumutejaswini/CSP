<h3>MPC</h3>
<p>The MPC full form in intermediate studies is Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, thus, it puts thrust on these three main areas. With a diverse curriculum, MPC subjects offer a wide range of career opportunities to explore.</p>
<h4>A Detailed Analysis of MPC Subjects</h4>
<h5>Maths</h5>
<p>Mathematics as a subject not only hones our problem solving and analytical skills but also enhances our reasoning ability. While Physics and Chemistry introduce us to the laws of the world, Math helps in establishing the relationship between them</p>
<h5>physics</h5>
<p>Physics is one of the oldest and most diverse fields of Science. It is a fundamental discipline that deals with the study of matter, energy, nature and their interdependence</p>
<h5>Chemistry</h5>
<p>After Physics and Maths, Chemistry forms an integral part of MPC Subjects. If Physics is the study of matter then Chemistry is the study of the structure, composition and properties of matter. The following are the five core branches of this subject</p>
<ul>
<li> Organic Chemistry</li>
<li> Inorganic Chemistry</li>
<li> Analytical Chemistry</li>
<li> Physical Chemistry</li>
<li>Biochemistry</li>
</ul>
