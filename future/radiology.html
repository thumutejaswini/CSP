<h3 style="color:green">What is Diploma in Radiology/Diploma in X-Ray?</h3>
<p>In India, a two-year undergraduate/diploma program in X-ray and radiology technology is available. The study deals with electromagnetic radiation that enters the human body and uses photographic film to portray solid things.

 

The healthcare industry is growing, and specialists from a variety of professions are needed to ensure that a country's healthcare sector is well-managed. The electromagnetic radiations entering the human body and form images of internal structures on photographic film are the subject of this course, following the doctor's diagnosis and treatment of the problem.

 

Radiography is the study of a medical subfield that uses Fluoroscopy, Angiography, X-ray, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging, CT Scan (Computed Tomography), and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) to identify illnesses and diseases of the internal and hidden portions of the body. This programme covers both therapeutic and diagnostic radiography, which involves the use of radiation to treat malignancies and tumours. This research involves subjects and issues such as Clinical Radiotherapy, Radiobiology, Ultrasound (Sonography), Clinical Chemotherapy, Clinical Trials, and Palliative Care.
